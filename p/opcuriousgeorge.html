	While there have been many powerful entities
	in a variety of stories, in my opinion I think one of them being of great power:<br>
	<div><em>Curious George.</em></div><br>
	Curious George is a monkey that is very curious, and is owned by a man named Ted (although more commonly known as The Man in the Yellow Hat). Curious George is very curious, and he is very good at this skill. He is good, but somewhat chaotic at times. But how does this lead to him beating people like Goku, Thanos, or Batman?
</p>
<p>
	This is how it goes:<br>
	It's a normal day for Curious George. He does his bussiness no problem. He takes a walk around his house. It's all fine. He goes to the park. He sees a bunch of people. Nothing wrong with that, right? But then he sees Ted's car. He gets in the car, and sees a button. He presses it, only to find out he needs keys. He gets out of the car, and secretly steals the keys from Ted's pocket. He drives very recklessly, hitting all these things, but with his curiousity, he manages it very well. By the time Ted notices, it's too late: <em>He's already gone</em>.
</p>
<p>
	He slips off the driveway a few times, but he sooner or later gets to... a mysterious place. (Atleast, for George.) It's strange, two large chimneys that basically make up the place. He gets out of the car, and walks into the place. He sees a bunch of people,all wearing white suits, except for a few. They all look like they're wearing a mask. He walks up to them. They wear yellow suits, just like Ted.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly, one of them notices Curious George. He's not allowed to be in this place. They all walk towards him. Curious George, while curious, knows that he's not allowed to be in this place. He runs away, but all the people there started chasing him. Curious George assumes nothing good happens when he gets caught. He runs away, and he runs away, and he runs away, and he runs away, and he runs away... Until.
</p>
<p>
	Curious George finds a chute blocked by these window looking things. It's a vent. Curious George climbs in, and he finds himself in a thin passage. He makes sure to close the vent behind him, so it doesn't look like he went through that way. He walks around the passage, and he another vent. It leads to a room. Curious George walks in, and he sees many test tubes, beakers, and other instruments. He becomes <strong>very</strong> curious about this. He eventually drinks one, a feat many wouldn't do. He soon finds out why. He feels very naseous. He sneaks through the vents, and drives for a few tens of miles, only to pass out, and swerve off a cliff.
</p>
<p>
	Curious George wakes up, and he's in a room. He's in a room. He's in a room. He's in a room. He's in a room. He's in a room. He's in a room. He's in a-
</p>
<p>
	He wakes up. It was all a dream. Except it wasn't all a dream. He feels light-headed for a while, then finds out he crashed Ted's car. Oh no. Ted's going to KILL him. What does he do? Over all this anxiety, he decides to... pass out.
</p>
<p>
	He wakes up again. Yeah, it's definetely NOT a dream. He thinks for a while. His curiousity did get the better of him this time. He remembers the phrase: "Curiousity killed the cat." Well, now it's going to kill him. He walks around in circles. Suddenly, in the blink of an eye, it's night. Wait, what? How did that happen? Then all of a sudden, he feels... great. Somehow. He soon finds himself running on the road for hours at a time. He doesn't feel tired even a bit. Eventually, he finds a car in the midle of the road. He gets in the car, and he drives off. 
</p>
<p>
	Shout out to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Tyrecordslol">this guy</a> for this stupidity.
</p>
<p>
	George then finds a sign, saying "&lt;- Nuclear Power Plant". Ah, so that was what it was. George has a flashback to when he sneaked inside a school. He learnt that when a neutron hits an atom, it loses two neutrons, while also creating a spark of energy. If those neutrons then hit other atoms, and those neutrons hit other atom, and so on, it could-wait, what was he thinking of again? Eh, it probably didn't matter. He just wanted to get out of here.
</p>
<p>
	George keeps on driving, but he doesn't find anything. In this fit of rage, he suddenly punches the steering wheel. It breaks. The car stops, sounding an alarm. George was never this strong before.
